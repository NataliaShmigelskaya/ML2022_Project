# Complex neural network to detect and classify animals in the wild

Final project for the Machine Learning course in Skoltech 2022

Object recognition and object detection are computer vision tasks to identifying objects and predicting the class of one object in an image. Our paper deals on the development of neural network to detect and classify animals in the wild nature. 

We used Scaled-YOLOv4 for object detection and U-Net with ResNet-34 Encoder
